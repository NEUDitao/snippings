# Food
- There's food on the windowsill by the sink
- Wet + Dry Food. I usually feed her about a can of wet food in the mornings,
  (or two packets of those little half packets of Sheba), and a quarter cup 
  of dry food.
  - Dry food is done by the autofeeder. Don't worry about it
- Treats are in the cabinets under the counter directly to the left of the
  fridge. She's a little ambivalent to shrimp but will eat it. She loves the
  temptations. And of course, churu.
- When you give her food, you can just dump the can into the bowl.
- I just have the two bowls for convenience (let one soak while she eats
  with the other one, then wash the next day). It doesn't smell.

# Water
- There should be enough water in the fountain. If not, take off the top, 
  and put some water from the Brita in

# Litter
- Check the litter box once a day. The Litter Genie shouldn't fill up while
  I'm gone

# Emergencies
- If there's an emergency, bring her to Huron if they have space, or an
MSPCA emergency room
- She might start panting because it's pretty warm. If so, please bring
  her to a vet. Better safe to be sorry.

# How often to visit
- You can visit once or twice a day
- She's most likely hiding:
  - under the bed
  - in the little cat cave
  - on the bed in the sheets
- She'll come out if you shake the treats.

# Play
- toys are in the drawer next to the couch. She really likes the green
  feather wand, and the cardboard thing. There are also some catnip
  based toys above the sink, which she loves. Keep them out while you visit
  if you'd like, and then put them away when you're done. They'll make
  her extra affectionate, and possibly high AF.
- she's kind of hard to get to play for more than 5 minutes at a time,
  with the cardboard, she loves being on the couch. With the feather,
  it's 50/50. As long as she's happy
- Not a fan of the outdoors

# Petting Her
- she likes being pet almost everywhere but the stomach. Head, cheek, ears,
and recently I've found, butt!
