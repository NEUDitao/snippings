# Food
- There's food in the top cabinet above the sink
- Wet + Dry Food. I usually feed her about a can of wet food in the mornings,
  and a quarter cup of dry food.
  - Dry food is provided in one of the slow-feeding mechanisms (the green ball,
  the puzzle toy in the cabinet, or the green tube digging thing).
  Whichever one's used doesn't matter, but when using the ball,
  make sure that she can't get it stuck behind the kitchen counter/trash can)
- Treats are also up there. She might want some. She loves both the fish ones
  and the chicken bits. She also loves churu
- When you give her food, you can just dump the can into the bowl.
- I just have the two bowls for convenience (let one soak while she eats
  with the other one, then wash the next day). It doesn't smell.

# Water
- There should be enough water in the fountain. If not, take off the top, 
  and put some water from the Brita in

# Litter
- Check the litter box once a day. The Litter Genie shouldn't fill up while
  I'm gone

# Emergencies
- If there's an emergency, bring her to Huron if they have space, or an
MSPCA emergency room
- She might start panting because it's pretty warm. If so, please bring
  her to a vet. Better safe to be sorry.

# How often to visit
- You can visit once or twice a day. Preferably twice, just to make sure
  she's doing ok with food, but once is fine too (as long as the wet food
  isn't out for more than 24 hours)
- She's most likely hiding:
  - under the bed
  - where my pants are (behind my bedroom door)
  - in the little cat cave
  - on the bed in the sheets
- She'll come out if you shake the treats.

# Play
- toys are in the cabinet next to the couch. She really likes the green
  feather wand, and the cardboard thing. There are also some catnip
  based toys above the sink, which she loves. Keep them out while you visit
  if you'd like, and then put them away when you're done. They'll make
  her extra affectionate, and possibly high AF.
- she's kind of hard to get to play for more than 5 minutes at a time,
  with the cardboard, she loves being on the couch. With the feather,
  it's 50/50. As long as she's happy
- Not a fan of the outdoors
- Please check up on the bird-feeder. It usually takes 72 hours to empty,
so it should be fine. Not mandatory, but it'd be nice

# Petting Her
- she likes being pet almost everywhere but the stomach. Head, cheek, ears,
and recently I've found, butt!
