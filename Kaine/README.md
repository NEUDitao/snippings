V1: Updated MG24 (2/8/24 -> 2/13/24)


# Food
- There's food in the top cabinet above the sink
- Wet + Dry Food. I usually feed her about a can of wet food over the course
  of two meals in the day, if she eats the whole can. If she doesn't, then
  I just provide her the wet food
- Treats are also up there. She might want some. She loves both the fish ones
  and the chicken bits
- Try to vary the food, you can feed her the same thing twice each day
- When you give her food, you can use a spoon to get it out of a can.
- For new cans, just put it in the metal bowl (I wash the metal bowl every
  day). Then, you can put one of the caps on the can  

# Water
- There should be enough water in the fountain. If not, take off the top, 
  and put some water from the Brita in

# Litter
- Check the litter box once a day. The Litter Genie shouldn't fill up while
  I'm gone

# Emergencies
- If there's an emergency, bring her to any vet. I haven't gone yet, but
  I'm currently signed up for the Huron vet

# How often to visit
- You can visit once or twice a day. Preferably twice, just to make sure
  she's doing ok with food, but once is fine too (as long as the wet food
  isn't out for more than 24 hours)

# Play
- toys are in the cabinet next to the couch. She really likes the green
  feather wand, and the cardboard thing. There are also some catnip
  based toys above the sink, though I don't really use them that often
- she's kind of hard to get to play for more than 5 minutes at a time,
  with the cardboard, she loves being on the couch. With the feather,
  it's 50/50. As long as she's happy
- If you're really feeling bold, you can take her out in the catpack.
  I've only taken her out for 10 minutes so far, so I don't know how
  she's going to react
