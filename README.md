# Snippings
These are some of the projects I code for fun, but then cleaned up for Github.

None of them are quite useful. In fact, most of them are probably shitshows that can't
be replicated on other machines, due to me never really, well, testing them for that
or seeking to make anything maintainable. But maybe?
